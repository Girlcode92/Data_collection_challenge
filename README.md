# Data_collection_challenge

To complete this challenge I identified HTML elements on a page, identified their id and class attributes, and used this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I also scraped HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage. Using this information I analyzed Mars weather data.
